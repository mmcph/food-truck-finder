		<p>This app connects hungry customers to food trucks by allowing the food truck owners to post their locations, hours of operation, and menus to an app that displays that information on an embedded Google map. Our app will strengthen the Albuquerque food truck scene by improving food trucks’ visibility and customers’ experiences.</p>
