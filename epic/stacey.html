		<h1>Persona: Vendor</h1>
		<div>
		<h2>Stacey Sellers</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Age: 32</li>
				<li>Gender: Female</li>
				<li>Profession: Frozen Custard truck owner</li>
				<li>Technology: Galaxy s7 with Android 8.0, and a Windows 8.1 Dell Inspiron 3000 laptop</li>
				<li>Attitude: Stacey loves her business, though it's hard work. She loves repeat customers,
					and she wants more exposure.</li>
				<li>Goals: Stacey needs an easier way of getting repeat customers and new customers. Many of her customers have expressed frustration that they have not been able to track her when they were
					craving some of her custard. She uses Facebook to update her hours and location, but sometimes she forgets to do this, and not everyone uses Facebook.</li>
				<li>Frustrations: Stacey has considered using other sites like roaminghunger.com, but many people in Albuquerque are not aware of this site. It requires several steps to find her food truck, and she would rather have something local.</li>
			</ul>
